A little funky starting new project
 - Partly my fault - I didn't set up the angular app correctly, hoping the AI could do it for me - ng new
 - It assumed I was using css, dumb but easy fix
Some prompts with Claude, but forced to use 4o-mini because of errors, unsure if this is assisstant or claude's fault
I asked it to make the game faster the longer the snake is, but I can't take a screencap of that, haha
Styling is off
    - Randomly it stopped centering the game
	- Then it centered it vertically too
	    - Fixed it, but only mostly?
	- It's generated styling allowed for a scrollable space, even though the contents fit completely in viewport. Messes up space to pause.
It eventually got lost and stopped returning whole files, with exceptions (Again, assistant or model?)
Not having diff or offering to replace specific parts of code is exhausting
Create a file doesn't really work either, it just gives it a dumb name in addition to the existing file
